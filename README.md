💡 Task 1: Smart Light Control:

This IoT project demonstrates how to control an LED remotely using the Blynk IoT platform and an ESP32 microcontroller. It allows users to toggle the LED ON or OFF from a smartphone via the Blynk app.

📲 Overview:

The ESP32 is connected to an LED on GPIO2. A virtual button in the Blynk app (assigned to Virtual Pin V0) sends a digital signal to control the LED. When the button is pressed, the ESP32 receives the command over Wi-Fi and turns the LED ON or OFF accordingly. The system also prints the LED status ("ON" or "OFF") to the Serial Monitor for debugging.

🧰 Components Used:

 ✦ESP32 Dev Board

✦LED

✦220Ω Resistor

✦Blynk App (Template ID, Name, Auth Token)

✦Wokwi Simulator (for testing without hardware)

⚙️ Features:

✔LED control via smartphone app

✔Real-time status updates in Serial Monitor

✔Reliable Wi-Fi-based communication

✔Simulatable on Wokwi for testing

🔌 Connections:

LED anode → GPIO2 (through 220Ω resistor)

LED cathode → GND

📱 Blynk Configuration:

➤Template Name: Smart Light Control Task 1

➤Virtual Pin Used: V0

➤Button Widget Mode: Switch (ON/OFF)
